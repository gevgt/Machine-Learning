# Machine-Learning
Self written library of Machine Learning algorithms [Python]

This library includes my interpretation of commonly known Machine Learning techniques written as functions. Currently available are:

- Clustering, wich belongs to the class of unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms.
- K-Nearest-Neighbors, which optimizes with Cross Validation to find the optimal value for K. Furthermore, the number of    folds is adaptable.
