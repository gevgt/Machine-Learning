# Machine-Learning
Collection of self-written Machine Learning algorithms [Python]

This collection includes my interpretation of commonly known Machine Learning techniques written as functions. Currently available are:

- Clustering, wich belongs to the class of unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms.
- K-Nearest-Neighbors, which optimizes with Cross Validation to find the optimal value for K. Furthermore, the number of folds is adaptable.
- Logistic Regression, which is an classification algorithm. The log-likelihood function is maximized by a numeric solution, the Newton Raphson Method.
